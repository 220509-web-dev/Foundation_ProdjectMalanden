drwxrwxrwx

d = directory
r = read
w = write
x = execute

d rwx     rwx     rwx
  |       |       |
  owner   group   all users
  
-----------------------

Using binary references to set file permissions:

r = 4
w = 2
x = 1

0 = no permissions
1 = only execute
2 = only write
3 = execute and write
4 = only read
5 = execute and read
6 = read and write
7 = read, write, and execute

----------------------

Shorthand permissions (not an all inclusive list)

chmod +x <file-name> (grants execute permissions to all user levels)
chmod +r <file-name> (grants read permissions to all user levels)
chmod -r <file-name> (removes read permissions to all user levels)

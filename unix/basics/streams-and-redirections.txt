Custom file descriptors can be referenced using redirection syntax (> or >>) and any number above 2

Redirections


> redirects output from a command to some destination (usage: echo "Hello, world" > hello.txt)

>> does the same as >, but will append rather than overwrite data (usage: echo "more data for the file" >> hello.txt)

< takes the second operand and uses it as input to the first operand


Piping

| chains or automatically redirects output from the first operand to the second operand as input
